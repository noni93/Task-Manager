Domain Model
This section should included your detailed list of responsibilities, associations, and attributes as described in the slides on domain analysis. It must also include a fully detailed domain model.  This should flow naturally from your existing work on use cases and research on existing products.  Include as many diagrams as are necessary to convey your model. I'm more concerned that you have fully fleshed out the responsibilities and their relationships than you have pretty pictures. 

System Design
Here we are breaking away from analysis and specifying our design. You should probably have a much better idea with respect to your architecture at this point so weave those decisions into this section. You must include class diagrams that reflect your domain model. They do not have to be super fancy, however.  You should be learning from your design section. Make sure that you are not just doing busy work here. I do expect to see identified responsibilities, relationships, and attributes found in the previous sections reflected in this section as well as in your code. 

Your goal here is not to replicate your implementation, but to provide a document from which somebody else could implement the system that you have designed. Constantly ask yourself whether you are meeting that goal while you are writing. 


Algorithms and Data Structures
If your system has any complex algorithms, e.g., statistical inference, you will ned to describe them in detail here. You will also need to describe your data model in detail here. How are you storing your data and why? How do your choices mitigate issues that we faced in our original implementation of TM.  


User Interface Design and Implementation

Describe whether and how you modified and implemented the initial screen mock-ups developed in assignment 1. If you didn't implement any mockups then, you will need to do so now.  
The textbook does not deal much with the GUI design. Excellent guidelines for GUI design can be found here:

"Ease-of-use" is generally considered the key characteristic of user interface. "Ease-of-use" should not be confused with a flashy interface, with lots of colors, picture, graphics, etc. On the contrary, you should avoid flashy user interfaces. "Ease-of-use" means that interface is intuitive, easy to understand and operate, without having to ask many questions or read voluminous documentation. A minimal user interface that is well organized should be sufficient. You should strive to minimize the user effort, thus maximizing the "ease-of-use".

Progress Report and Plan of Work
Progress Report

What use cases have been implemented? 
What is already functional, what is currently being tackled?
	*Currently the website is cosmetically intact, it is visually ready.
	*Some adjustments need to be made with the javascript.

Plan of Work

List the projected milestones and dates by which you plan to accomplish them. 

Breakdown of Responsibilities

To the best of your ability, List the names of modules and classes that each team member is currently responsible for developing, coding, and testing

Who will coordiante the integration?

Who will perform the testing of the integrated system?

You will NOT get everything right the first (or the second) time. Do you best given your experience and be prepared to revise and adjust for subsequent assignments. 

We will discuss this further in class, and there may be minor updates to the assignment.
