Group Project Design
======================

Introduction
---------------------
Due to increase in the complexity of projects, it has become increasingly important for todayâ€™s corporations to optimize their workload and available resources to effectively achieve their project goals. The goal of our project is to create a task management web application for corporations to manage their projects, meet deadlines, track their progress on approved projects, prioritize their projects to effectively use available resources and budget or time to complete their projects, share feedback on projects and associated tasks.  The main user of this web application will be ultimately corporations with distributed and dynamic usage of this web app across different teams within those corporations . This web app will allow the employees to propose certain task with its priority, start and estimated stop dates, description, and much more attributes, which then will be approved and assigned appropriately by managers. This web app will allow all users to track their progress on their respective projects as well as team and the whole corporation projects. All team members on this project have been divided to solve certain problems about this application and then finally coming together to combine all optimized solutions to build this application. The teamwork and the passion to solve real world problem are two most important factors that motivate us to solve this problem using software engineering principles and best practices and ultimately improve our problem-solving skills.
